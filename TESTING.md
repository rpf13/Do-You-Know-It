- As a visiting user, I would like to have an immediate overview of the site and how the quiz works
    -> Fullfilled via the simple and self-explanatory interface
- As a visiting user, I can see the status of the running quiz, how many questions are left, how many correct and wrong answers
    -> Fullfilled via the quiz status bar, showing correct-, incorrect questions amount as well as at which, out of how many questions, the player is currently at.
- As a visiting user, I always have the chance to abort the game and go back to the main site
    -> Fullfilled via the Cancel button on the top right of the quiz card.

    -> Github repo "top right corner button" available on each site, on every card displayed.
